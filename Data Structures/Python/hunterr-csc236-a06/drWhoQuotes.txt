I don't age. I regenerate. But humans decay; you wither and you die. Imagine watching that happen to someone that you—

Hello! Oka! New teeth. That's weird. So where was I? Oh, that's right — Barcelona!

Back to your mum. It's all waiting. Fish and chips, sausage and mash, beans on toast... No! Christmas! Turkey! Although, having met your mother, nutloaf would be more appropriate.

Think you've seen it all? Think again. Outside those doors, we might see anything. We could find new worlds, terrifying monsters, impossible things. And if you come with me... nothing will ever be the same again!

Now, first things first. Be honest. How do I look?

Good different or bad different?

Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Oh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.

Well, you could do that. Yeah, you could do that. Of course you could. But why? Look at these people, these human beings. Consider their potential! From the day they arrive on the planet, blinking, step into the sun, there is more to see than can ever be seen, more to do than — no, hold on. Sorry, that's The Lion King. But the point still stands. Leave them alone!

Don't challenge me, Harriet Jones! 'Cause I'm a completely new man! I could bring down your government with a single word!

No, you're right. Not a single word; just six.

Trouble's just the bits-in-between! It's all waiting out there, Jackie. And it's brand new to me—all those planets and creatures and horizons! I haven't seen them yet, not with these eyes. And it is gonna be... fantastic!

 It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. What?

What does that mean?

Tell me the rest.

I got the impression there was something you wanted to tell me.

So the legend says.

Oh, does it have to?!

That is enigmatic. That is textbook enigmatic.

Oh, I'm, I'm dazed and confused. I've been chasing this... this wee-naked child over hill and over dale. Ain't that right, ya... tim'rous beastie?

And, I'll tell you something else: We just met Queen Victoria!

They say the wages of the entire planet for a whole week.

You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.

Something to tell the grandkids.

Right. Yes, sorry. I didn't get a chance to ask. You haven't... There hasn't been anyone? You know...?

Oh, it's not goodbye—

Goodbye... my Sarah Jane!

Don't worry Reinette, it's just a nightmare. Everyone has nightmares; even big scary monsters from under the bed have nightmares, don't you, monster?

Oh, this and that. Became the imaginary friend of a future French aristocrat, picked a fight with a clockwork man... [A horse whinnies off screen] Oh, and I met a horse.

Mickey, what's pre-revolutionary France doing on a spaceship? Get a little perspective!

Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time.

Umm... you can let go now.

If you want to know what's going on, work in the kitchen.

Yeah. Lucy says that that is the President of Great Britain.

Seems so.

I'm telling you, don't!

I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room.

Well, this could still be New York. I mean, this looks very New York to me. Sort of a London-y New York, mind you, but...

Hold on a minute. You've got hands, Mr. Connolly. Two big hands. So why's that your wife's job?

And are you suggesting that the Queen does the housework?

And I'm not listening! Now you, Mr Connolly — you are staring into a deep, dark pit of trouble if you don't let me help! So I'm ordering you, sir! Tell me what's going on!

What! They left her where?

They took her face and just chucked her out in the street. As a consequence that makes this simple... very, very simple. Because now, Detective Inspector Bishop, there is no power on this earth that can stop me!

I don't know what is wrong with her, she's sort of... queasy, indigestion... like she didn't want to land.

I've trapped you here.

Oh, come on! Did you have to? "No turning back", that's almost as bad as "Nothing could possibly go wrong", or "This is gonna be the best Christmas Walford's ever had!"

Yeah. Finished.

You get representations of the horned beast right across the Universe. In the myths and legends of a million worlds: Earth, Draconia, Vel Considene, Daemos, the Kaled God of War: it's the same image, over and over again. Maybe that idea came from somewhere, bleeding through, a thought at the back of every sentient mind.

Well, if that's what you want to believe. Maybe that's what the Devil is in the end: an idea.

If you get back in touch... if you talk to Rose... just tell her... tell her I... Oh, she knows.

I've seen fake gods and bad gods and demigods and would-be gods; out of all that, out of that whole pantheon, if I believe in one thing... just one thing... I believe in her.

Someone wants a word with you.

Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice.

Snakes and Ladders? Quite good at... squash? I'm being facetious, I... There's no call for it.

I'm a... I'm a police officer, that's what I am! I've got a badge, and a police car, and I can prove it! I've got—

See? Look, I've got a colleague.

Trainee. New recruit. It was either that or hairdressing.

Never say never, ever.

Something in the air. Something's coming. A storm's approaching...

How long are you going to stay with me?

I think it's horrific.

Allons-y!

But if I’m the enemy, does that mean I'm a prisoner?

Yes. Sorry, good point. She's just a bit shy, that's all.

But here she is, Rose Tyler! Hm, she's not the best I've ever had. Bit too blonde. Not too steady on her pins. A lot of that.  And just last week she stared into the heart of the time vortex and aged 57 years. But she'll do.

Deluded. Bless. I'll have to trade her in. Do you need anyone? She's very good at tea. Well, when I say "very good" I mean not bad. Well, I say "not bad"—anyway, lead on. Allons-y! But not too fast. Her ankle's going.

Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother!

I've got a reputation to uphold!

The Doctor will not.

That's screwdriver!

Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word. That's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do. It is very good at opening doors.

Quite right, too. And I suppose, if it's my last chance to say it... Rose Tyler...

I'm... I'm not... I'm not - I'm not from Mars.

Do you have this effect on everyone? Why aren't they stopping?

Hello. I'm the Doctor.

Yes, I gather.

Oh, is that what she's offered you, the Empress of the Racnoss? What are you, her consort?

Guess what I've got, Donna?  Pockets!

Mm, you got me there.  Although, there is always this.

They're bigger on the inside.

My mate Ben. That was a day and a half: I got rope burns off that kite, and then I got soaked...

...and then I got electrocuted!

You're talking like you're some sort of alien.

You're joshing me!

I'm talking to an alien? In hospital?! What, has this place got an E.T. department?

Crossing into established events is strictly forbidden. Except for cheap tricks.

Is it? I hadn't noticed.

Of course we can. Why do you ask?

I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?

Are you planning to?

Well, then.

Come on! We can all have a good flirt later!

Oooh, 57 academics just punched the air!

Harry Potter Wait 'til you read Book Seven. Oh, I cried.

You should write that down.

...Meh.

Expelliarmus!

What?!

What?!

What?!

Um, yeah. Yeah, it was, yeah.

What's wrong with that?

Don't, there's no need for that.

Yeah, but not yet; who needs secrets, eh?

That's why we have to survive, both of us. Don't go.

It really doesn't matter.

I lied to you, 'cause I liked it. I could pretend, just for a bit, I could imagine they were still alive... underneath that burnt orange sky. I'm not just a Time Lord, I'm the last of the Time Lords. The Face of Boe was wrong. There's no one else.

There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks... for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Oh, you should have seen it, that old planet! The second sun would rise in the south, and the mountains would shine. The leaves on the trees were silver. When they caught the light, every morning it looked like a forest on fire. When the Autumn came, a brilliant glow though the branches...

Daleks are bad enough at any time, but right now they're vulnerable, and that makes them more dangerous than ever.

Removing the emotions makes you stronger. That's what your creator thought, all those years ago.

He was what?

Then you wouldn't be the supreme beings anymore.

Oh, Tallulah with three Ls and an H. Just you watch me. What do I need? Oh, I dunno, how about a great big genetic laboratory? Oh look, I've got one. Lazlo, just you hold on! There have been too many deaths today. Way too many people have died. Brand new creatures and wise old men and age-old enemies, and I tell you, I tell you right now, I am not having one more death!

Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens.

Really shouldn't take that long just to reverse the polarity. Must be a bit out of practice!

This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a whimper.

Some people live more in twenty years than others do in eighty. It's not the time that matters, it's the person.

What about the other people who died?!

Any of them might have done too. You think history is only made with equations?! Facing death is part of being human; you can't change that.

Look at yourself! You're mutating! You've got no control over it, and you call it a success?!

There's no such thing as an ordinary human.

I'm old enough to know that a longer life isn't always a better one. In the end, you just get tired; tired of the struggle, tired of losing everyone that matters to you, tired of watching everything you love turn to dust. If you live long enough, Lazarus, the only certainty left is that you'll end up alone.

Is it?

What is it now!?

Elvis. No! The Beatles. No! Wait, um... um... awww, that remix... um... I don't know, I am a bit busy.

Now where was I?... Here comes the sun... No, resources.

Oh, I think the explanation might be you've been fooled by a simple olfactory misdirection, a little bit like ventriloquism of the nose. It's an elementary trick in certain parts of the galaxy. But it has gotta be said: I don't like the look of that hydrokinometer. It seems to be indicating you've got energy feeding back all the way through the retro-stabilisers feeding back into the primary heat converter.  'Cause if there's one thing you shouldn't have done, you shouldn't have let me press all those buttons. But, in fairness, I will give you one word of advice: Run!

This is my timey-wimey detector. It goes "ding!" when there's stuff. Also, it can boil an egg at 30 paces, whether you want it to or not, actually, so I've learned to stay away from hens. It's not pretty when they blow.

Yep, that's me.

Yes I do.

Yep, and this.

Are you going to read out the whole thing?

People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but, actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.

I was busy.

You two, we're at the end of the universe. Okay?! Right at the edge of knowledge itself! And you're busy... 

Oh, might have spent a million years evolving into clouds of gas... and another million as downloads, but you always revert to the same basic shape: the fundamental human. End of the universe and here you are. Indomitable, that's the word! Indomitable! Ha!

And... Utopia is...?

Bit of a hermit.

Hermits United. We meet up every ten years, swap stories about caves. It's good fun. For a hermit.

He was a friend, at first...

You've been watching too much TV.

Well, perfect to look at, maybe. And it was, it was beautiful. They used to call it the Shining World of the Seven Systems. And on the continent of Wild Endeavour, in the mountains of Solace and Solitude, there stood the Citadel of the Time Lords. The oldest and most mighty race in the universe. Looking down on the galaxies below, sworn never to interfere, only to watch. Children of Gallifrey were taken from their families at the age of eight, to enter the Academy. Some say that's where it all began, when he was a child. That's when the Master saw eternity. As a novice, he was taken for initiation. He stood in front of the Untempered Schism. It's a gap in the fabric of reality through which could be seen the whole of the vortex. We stand there, eight years old, staring at the raw power of Time and Space, just a child. Some would be inspired. Some would run away. And some would go mad. Oh, I dunno.

Oh, the ones that ran away! I never stopped.

Oh! I know what it's like. It's like when you fancy someone and they don't even know you exist. That's what it's like. Come on!

You wouldn't listen. Because you know what I'm going to say...

I forgive you.

You're not dying, don't be stupid. It's only a bullet. Just regenerate.

One little bullet, come on.

Regenerate. Just regenerate. Please. Please! Just regenerate! Come on!

But you've got to. Come on. It can't end like this. You and me, all the things we've done. Axons, remember the Axons? And the Daleks? We're the only two left. I have no one else. Regenerate!

Need this?

Oh, no, of course. You liked to go hands free, didn't you? Like, "Hey, I'm the Doctor. I can save the universe using a kettle and some string. And look at me, I'm wearing a vegetable!"

What? What?! What?

Excuse me? Sorry, sorry, but, um... where did you get all this from?

I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous. I'm nine hundred and three years old, and I'm the man who's gonna save your lives and all six billion people on the planet below. You got a problem with that?

In that case... allons-y!

Actually, that's not true. Christmas is a time of, of peace, and thanksgiving, and... ohh, what am I on about? My Christmases are always like this!

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Security protocol one! Do you hear me? One! One-ah! [The Hosts pause their attack.] OK. That gives me three questions. Three questions to save my life, am I right?

No, that wasn't one of them! I didn't mean it! That's not fair! Can I start again?

No! No, no, no, no! That wasn't a question either! Blimey... One question left. One question. All right. So. You've been given orders to kill the survivors but survivors; therefore, must be passengers or staff. But not me. I'm not a passenger, I'm not staff. Go ahead, scan me. [The Hosts do so.] You must have bio-records. No such person on board. I don't exist. Therefore, you can't kill me. Therefore, I'm a stowaway; and stowaways should be arrested and taken to the nearest figure of authority. And I reckon... the nearest figure of authority... is on deck 31. Final question - am I right?

Brilliant. Take me to your leader. I've always wanted to say that!

Ohh, that's clever. That's an omni-state impact chamber. Indestructible! You could survive anything in there! You could sit through a supernova... or a shipwreck. Only one person can have the power and the money to hide themselves onboard like this, and I should know, because...

It really does that?!?

Yes! No... Yes! Your business isn't failing, it's failed. Past-tense.

If you had a back.

What's your first name?

You're kidding me!

There's something else I've always wanted to say. Allons-y, Alonso!

Astrid Peth, citizen of Sto. The woman who looked at the stars and dreamed of travelling. Now you can travel forever. You're not falling, Astrid... You're flying!

Not now!

What the hell are you doing there?

What for?!

Run!

With Martha, like I said, it got... complicated. And that was all my fault. I just want a mate.

I just want a mate!

A mate! I want A mate!

I am...Spartacus.

Oh, no-no-no-no-no, we're not married.

Really?!

Yes way, Appian Way!

Oh, that'll be the day.

Oh that's all right.  Just us girls. You know, I met the Sybil once. Hell of a woman! Blimey, she could dance a tarantella! Nice teeth... Truth be told, I think she had a bit of a thing for me. I said it would never last, she said "I know". Well, she would. You all right there?

I like the toga.

Eh, not so much.

Didn't you think of moving away? On, no, then again, San Francisco.

The Doctor and Donna Noble.

Oh, no, no, no. We're not married.

Never.

Oh, I've, I've... sort of got a song of my own, thanks.

Meaning?

Name?

Oh that's no good. What if you get defeated? "Staal The Not-Quite-So-Undefeated-Any-More-But-Never-Mind"?

Ross, just one question: If UNIT think that ATMOS is dodgy...

Oh, nice one!

Are you my mummy?

Yeah, I'm really glad you didn't say belittle, 'cos then I'd have had a field day.

I don't know where we're going, but my old hand's very excited about it!

Well...

Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely.

It's taken a tissue sample, and extrapolated it. Some kind of accelerator?

Well that, that's just...

From me.

Well, she's... Well, she's my daughter.

You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up "genocide". You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read "Over my dead body".

I never would. Have you got that? I... never... would. When you start this new world, this world of Human and Hath, remember that. Make the foundation of this society a man who never would!

Ah! Smell that air! Grass and lemonade! And a little bit of mint. Just a hint of mint. Must be the 1920s.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, no-no-no-no, we're not married.

Oh, oh! You don't miss a trick.

So? Happens to me all the time.

Well...

There's no Noddy.

Salt! I was miming salt! I need salt! I need something salty!

What is it?!

That's too salty!

The Library. So big it doesn't need a name, just a great big "The".

Spoilers!

These books are from your future. If you read ahead, it will spoil all the surprises. Like peeping at the end.

I try to keep you away from major plot developments. Which, to be honest, I seem to be really bad at.

Oh, you're not, are you? Tell me you're not archaeologists.

I'm a time traveller. I point and laugh at archaeologists.

Almost every species in the universe has an irrational fear of the dark, but they're wrong, because it's not irrational. It's Vashta Nerada.

It's what's in the dark. It's what's always in the dark.

Don't play games with me. You just killed someone I liked and that is not a safe place to stand! I'm the Doctor and you're in the biggest Library in the universe. Look me up.

Why am I handcuffed? Why would you even have handcuffs?

You can let me do this!

Time can be rewritten!

River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could...

Ah, I'll be fine. Taking a big space truck with a bunch of strangers across a diamond planet called Midnight... What could possibly go wrong?

That'll be the peanuts.

Roast beef. Bananas. The Medusa Cascade. Bang!  Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, TARDIS! Shamble-bobble-dibble-dooble. Oh, Doctor, you're so handsome. Yes, I am, thank you.

What two words? What were they? What did she say?

It's the end of the universe!

Rose! Long time, no see!

I'm sorry, it's too late! I'm regenerating!

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

They're trying to help.

Who was that?

Davros, come with me! I promise I can save you!

Sarah, hold that. Mickey, you hold that. 'Cos you know why this TARDIS is always rattling about the place? Rose: that, there. It's designed to have six pilots and I have to do it single-handed- Martha, keep that level- But not any more! Jack, there you go, steady that. Now we can fly this thing- N-no, Jackie, no, no, not you. Don't touch anything, just... stand back. Like it's meant to be flown! We got the Torchwood rift looped around the TARDIS by Mr Smith. We are gonna fly Planet Earth back home. Right, then, off we go.

I just want you to know, there are worlds out there, safe in the sky because of her. That there are people living in the light, and singing songs of Donna Noble. A thousand, million light years away. They will never forget her, while she can never remember. But for one moment, one shining moment, she was the most important woman in the whole wide universe.

Then maybe you should tell her that once in a while!

You can't ever tell her!

Thank you.

I'm the Doctor! Simply "the Doctor"! The one, the only, and the best! [winks] Rosita, hand me the sonic screwdriver!

The what?

Now quickly, get back to the TARDIS.

Back to the what?

If you could stand back, sir, this is a job for a Time Lord.

Job for a what-lord?

Oh, that's different. 

Oh, that's new.

Allons-y!

It's strange, though. I talk of Cybermen... from the stars... and you don't blink, Mr. Smith.

Ah, don't blink, whatever you do, don't blink, remember that? The blinking and the statues and... Sally and the angels? No?

You're a very odd man.

Mmm... I still am.

I'm the Doctor.

Yeah, but that's cause your database got corrupted. Oh, look, look, look. Check this. The Doctor's info stamp. Plug it in, go on, download.

Ah, well, nice try!

Hello!

Come on, allons-y!

Oh, we were made for each other!

Did you just salute?

You too! Chops and gravy, lovely!

What do you mean?

The Doctor. Doctor. Fun.

No, 'cause someone told me just recently, they said I was going to die. They said, "he will knock four times," and I think I know what that means, and it doesn't mean right here, right now, 'cause I don’t hear anyone knocking, do you?

Three knocks is all you're getting! Water and electricity: bad mix! Now then what else have we got?

Heat! They use water; we can use heat! Works against the Ice Warriors, works against the Flood. Ramp up the environment controls and steam them!

But there are laws. There are laws of time. Once upon a time there were people in charge of those laws, but they died. They all died. Do you know who that leaves? Me! It's taken me all these years to realise the laws of time are mine, and they will obey me!

We're not just fighting the Flood, we're fighting Time itself! And I'm gonna win!

Adelaide, I've done this sort of thing before. In small ways, save some little people, but never anyone as important as you-oh, I'm good!

For a long time now, I thought I was just a survivor, but I'm not. I'm the winner! That's who I am. The Time Lord Victorious!

No.

That's for me to decide.

I've gone too far. Is this it? My death? Is it time!?

No!

Ah, now! Sorry, there you are. So, where we? I was summoned, wasn't I? The Ood in the snow, calling to me. Well, I didn't just have to come straight here; had a bit of fun. You know, traveled about, did this and that, got into trouble, you know me. But it was brilliant. I saw the phosphorous carousel of the Great Magellan Gestadt, saved a planet from the Red Carnivorous Maw, named a galaxy Alison. Got married! That was a mistake. Good Queen Bess. And let me tell you, her nickname is no longer--  anyway, what do you want?

Last time I was here, you said my song would be ending soon. And I'm in no hurry for that.

Hold on. Better lock the TARDIS. Eh? Like a car. I l— locked it, like a car. That's... funny. No? Little bit?  Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh...

I'm going to die.

Don't you dare!

But I was told: "He will knock four times". That was the prophecy: knock four times and then...

I can still die. If I'm killed before regeneration, then I'm dead. Even then, even if I change, it feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away... and I'm dead.

It's not that I'm an innocent. I've taken lives. I got worse, I got clever. Manipulated people into taking their own. Sometimes, I think a Time Lord lives too long...

There's an old Earth saying, Captain. A phrase of great power and wisdom and consolation to the soul in times of need.

Allons-y!!

Sure.

OK, right, then, I will. 'Cause you just had to go in there, didn't you? You had to go and get stuck, oh yes! Because that's who you are, Wilfred! You were always this. Waiting for me all this time!

Well, exactly, look at you. Not remotely important. But me... I could do so much more! So much more! But this is what I get, my reward. And it's not fair! Oh... lived too long...

I don't want to go.

Allons-y! There you go, Your Majesty, what did I tell you? Bigger on the inside!

Whatever you've got planned, forget it. I'm the Doctor. I'm 904 years old. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Casterborous. I am The Oncoming Storm, the Bringer of Darkness and you are basically just a rabbit, aren't you?

Compensating?

What?

Regeneration, it's a lottery.

Trenzalore... We need a new destination, 'cause... I don't want to go.
